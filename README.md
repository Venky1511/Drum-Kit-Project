# Drum-Kit-Project

This is a fun and interactive drum kit built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. You can play different drum sounds by either clicking the buttons on the screen or pressing specific keys on your keyboard.

Each key plays a unique sound — from snares to kicks — and also triggers a cool little animation to make it feel more realistic.

What it includes:

* Simple and clean UI with custom drum pad buttons
* Smooth keypress and click interactions
* Real-time audio playback
* Button animation for a better user experience
